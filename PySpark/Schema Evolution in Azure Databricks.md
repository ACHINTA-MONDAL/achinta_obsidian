**Introduction**

As data engineers, we often face scenarios where data schemas evolve over time — new columns are added, data types are changed, or even columns are removed. Handling these changes efficiently without disrupting ongoing operations is crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of your data pipelines. In this blog, we’ll explore how to manage schema evolution in Azure Databricks using Delta Lake. We’ll also walk through an end-to-end practical demo covering all possible combinations of schema changes.

**Understanding Schema Evolution in Delta Lake**

Schema Evolution in Delta Lake refers to the capability to handle changes in data schema, allowing tables to automatically adjust to new data structures. This is particularly useful in scenarios involving:

- Addition of new columns
- Changes in data types of existing columns
- Removal of columns

Delta Lake supports schema evolution through a set of features that make managing these changes seamless and efficient. This ensures that your data pipelines continue to run smoothly without manual interventions.

**Why Schema Evolution Matters**

In a rapidly changing data landscape, you often deal with datasets where the structure isn’t static. Imagine receiving data from multiple sources, each with slight variations in schema over time. Without schema evolution, you would need to manually adjust your table schema to fit the new data, leading to potential downtime and data inconsistencies.

**Practical Use Case: Schema Evolution in Azure Databricks**

Let’s consider a use case where we have a Delta table that ingests customer transaction data. Over time, the schema evolves with the addition of new columns, changes in data types, and even the removal of certain columns. We’ll walk through how to handle each of these scenarios.

**Step 1: Initial Setup**

1. Create a Delta Table:

First, we’ll create an initial Delta table with a simple schema.

2. Verify Initial Schema:

**Step 2: Adding a New Column**

Next, let’s simulate an incoming data batch that includes a new column, `transaction_date`.

1. New Data with an Additional Column:

2. Write Data with Schema Evolution:

Use the `mergeSchema` option to enable schema evolution.

3. Verify Updated Schema:

The updated schema should now include the `transaction_date` column.

**Step 3: Changing Data Type**

Let’s now consider a scenario where the data type of the `amount` column changes from `integer` to `float`.

1. Data with Updated Data Type:

2. Handle Data Type Change:

Unfortunately, schema evolution doesn’t handle data type changes automatically. To address this, you can explicitly cast the data type before writing.

3. Verify Schema and Data:

The schema remains the same, but we’ve successfully handled the data type change by casting.

Step 4: Deleting a Column

Finally, let’s look at what happens if we need to remove a column, such as `transaction_date`.

1. Manual Schema Update:

Delta Lake doesn’t support automatic removal of columns. You need to manually drop the column using SQL.

2. Verify Final Schema:

The final schema should no longer include the `transaction_date` column.

**Conclusion**

Schema evolution in Azure Databricks is a powerful feature that simplifies the handling of evolving data schemas in Delta Lake. Whether you’re dealing with the addition of new columns, changes in data types, or even the deletion of columns, Azure Databricks provides robust tools and options to manage these changes with minimal disruption to your data pipelines.

By understanding and applying these techniques, you can ensure that your data architecture is resilient, scalable, and ready for the dynamic nature of real-world data.
