# What is the Medallion Architecture?

The Medallion Architecture, also called the Delta Architecture, organizes data into three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each layer has a specific role in ensuring the quality and accessibility of data.

# Layers of Medallion Architecture

## 1. Bronze Layer: Raw Data

- **Purpose:** This is where raw data is stored right after it's collected from sources like databases, APIs, and IoT devices.
- **Characteristics**: The data is unprocessed and can have duplicates, errors, or inconsistencies.
- **Storage**: Usually stored in a data lake or distributed storage like HDFS or Amazon S3.

## 2. Silver Layer: Cleaned and Enriched Data

- **Purpose**: This layer cleans and processes the raw data from the Bronze layer.
- **Characteristics**: Data here is cleaner and more structured, with errors corrected and duplicates removed.
- **Storage**: Stored in structured formats like Parquet or Delta Lake tables.

## 3. Gold Layer: Aggregated and Curated Data

- **Purpose:** The Gold layer provides the best quality data, ready for analysis and reporting.
- **Characteristics**: Data is aggregated and highly curated, optimized for quick queries.
- **Storage**: Often stored in data warehouses like Snowflake or Amazon Redshift.

# Benefits of the Medallion Architecture

## 1. Improved Data Quality

- Each layer acts as a filter, progressively improving data quality. By the time data reaches the Gold layer, it's high quality and reliable.

## 2. Scalability

- The architecture handles growing data volumes easily and allows you to choose the best tools for each layer.

## 3. Easier Data Management

- Having distinct layers simplifies data management, making it easier to apply data governance, track data lineage, and manage access controls.

## 4. Better Performance

- Optimized storage formats and systems at each layer enhance query performance, especially in the Gold layer.

# Implementing the Medallion Architecture

## Step 1: Ingesting Data into the Bronze Layer

First, raw data is ingested into the Bronze layer using tools like Apache Kafka, AWS Glue, or Azure Data Factory.

# `Example using PySpark for data ingestion`  
`from pyspark.sql import SparkSession`  
`spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataIngestion").getOrCreate()`  
  
# `Reading data from a CSV file`  
`raw_data = spark.read.csv("s3://path-to-bronze-layer/raw_data.csv", header=True)`  
  
# `Writing data to the Bronze layer`  
`raw_data.write.format("delta").save("s3://path-to-bronze-layer/bronze_data")`

## Step 2: Processing Data in the Silver Layer

Next, the raw data is cleaned and transformed in the Silver layer.

# `Example data processing in the Silver layer`  
# `Reading data from the Bronze layer`  
`bronze_data = spark.read.format("delta").load("s3://path-to-bronze-layer/bronze_data")`  
  
# `Cleaning and transforming data`  
`cleaned_data = bronze_data.dropDuplicates().fillna("N/A")`  
  
# `Writing data to the Silver layer`  
`cleaned_data.write.format("delta").save("s3://path-to-silver-layer/silver_data")`

## Step 3: Aggregating Data in the Gold Layer

`Finally, the cleaned data is aggregated and optimized for analysis in the Gold layer.`

# `Example data aggregation in the Gold layer`  
# `Reading data from the Silver layer`  
`silver_data = spark.read.format("delta").load("s3://path-to-silver-layer/silver_data")`  
  
# `Aggregating data`  
`aggregated_data = silver_data.groupBy("category").agg({"sales": "sum"})`  
  
# `Writing data to the Gold layer`  
`aggregated_data.write.format("delta").save("s3://path-to-gold-layer/gold_data")`

# Conclusion

The Medallion Architecture is a smart way to manage and process data, ensuring high quality and great performance at each stage. By using this approach, data engineers can build reliable data pipelines that meet various analytical needs while keeping data integrity and scalability in check.

Whether you deal with large volumes of data or need strict data quality controls, the Medallion Architecture offers a reliable framework to achieve your data engineering goals.
